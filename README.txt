This ATM C# project was done during my City&Guilds Level 2 course. 
After entering account number and PIN and clicking Enter, input is validated and if correct the access is given to the user. Options allow Balance Check, Withdrawal, Lodgement and PIN change. Details of the accounts are stored in a text file C#test.txt
